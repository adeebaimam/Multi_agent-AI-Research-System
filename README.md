# 🔬 ResearchMind – Multi-Agent AI Research System

ResearchMind is an AI-powered Multi-Agent Research Assistant that performs automated web research using a team of specialized AI agents.

Instead of relying on a single LLM response, the system follows a multi-agent workflow where different agents are responsible for searching, reading, writing, and reviewing the research before generating the final report.
